## Discussion

- Student are more willing to participate in pacific than in radical actions.

- Both types of willingness tend to increase between 1999, 2009 and 2016.

- Latin American countries tend to be in top of the list in both types of participation.

---
## Discussion: inequality


- In more unequal contexts students tend to show higher disposition to participate in pacific actions. This results appear in 1999, 2009 and 2016.

- For the case of radical actions, unequal context seem to matter more in recent years.

- the results support the idea that inequalities generate more conflicts in society.

---
## Discussion: Individual factors

- Civic knowledge relevant role: tends to increase participation in pacific actions and decrese participation in radical actions. 

- Resources matters in two ways: intergenerational transmission of civic skills.

- Gender differences: girls tend to show lower dispositions than boys for radical actions but the differences seems to be shortened across time.

---
## Next steps

- Combining the data: some challenges about homologation of civic Knowledge scale.
