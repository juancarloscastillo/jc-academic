# Objectives

- To assess gaps regarding adolescents' willingness to participate in disruptive or radical forms of political actions

- To compare differences between countries and over time.

- To analyze the role of individual characteristics (parent's education, civic knowledge and gender) on youth political actions

- To evaluate the role of economic inequality

## Discussion

- The willingness to participate in radical actions increase between 1999, 2009 and 2016 but country variation on that patterns.

- Spraying seem to be a more common disposition than blocking the traffic, and both are more common than occupying

- Latin American countries tend to be in top of the list in both types of participation.

---
## Discussion: inequality

- In more unequal contexts students tend to show higher predisposition to participate in disruptive actions. This results appear mainly in 2016, less clear in 2009 and no in 1999.

- For the case of radical actions, unequal context seem to matter more in recent years.

- The results support the idea that inequalities generate more conflicting in society.

---
## Discussion: Individual factors

But, education (vía transmission of civic knowledge) have the potential to disencourage this type of actions.

- Civic knowledge relevant role: tends to increase participation decrease participation in radical actions. 

- Resources matters in two ways: intergenerational transmission of civic skills.

- Gender differences: girls tend to show lower predispositions than boys for radical actions but the differences seems to be shortened across time.

---
## Next steps

- Combining the data

- Comparability of participation measures

- Some challenges: harmonization of civic knowledge scale.
