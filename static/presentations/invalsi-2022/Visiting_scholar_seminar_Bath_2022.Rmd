**Introduction**

What are the factors and mechanisms that explain the intergenerational transmission of political inequality?

- Typologies of political participation

  + What is political participation for youth?
  + Continous expansion of repertoires
  + Theoretical and practical challenges

- Socialization of citizenship
  
  + Agents of socialization

- Different theories
  
  + Persistence or lifetime openness
  + Impresionable years
  + Lifecycle perspective

---
**Introduction**

- Socioeconomic inequality and political participation

   - Intergenerational transmission of political inequality: Transmission of status - resource model.
  
   - Intergenerational transmission of beliefs, identities, behavior: socialization model.
  
---
**Research question**

- To what extent is the association between family socioeconomic conditions and different types of citizen participation produced indirectly, through the transmission of resources from one generation to another?

- To what extent is the association between socioeconomic conditions of the family with different types of citizen participation produced indirectly, as a propensity of families to politically socialize the next generation?

- To what extent are the direct and/or indirect processes of intergenerational transmission of political inequality persistent over time?

**Youth Citizenship Panel Study**

The sample corresponds to young Chileans aged between 18 and 30 years. The study design has a longitudinal nature of three measurements:

- Wave 1: started on July 19, 2021. N= 3122

During the first measurement, a series of retrospective questions is implemented with the aim of characterizing the political behavior, cultural and socioeconomic resources of young people and their families during the period that refers to their secondary, tertiary and recent studies.

The following measurements characterize the behavior and political attitudes during the recent period (first and second semester of 2021, respectively)

- Wave 2: started on October 04, 2021. N= 1541
- Wave 3: started on December 30, 2021. N= 1065

**Discussion**

Socialization processes operate differently for different types of participation.

- Family resources model is especially relevant to explain electoral behavior, while online participation is mainly influenced by one's own achievement in education.

- Family resources on disruptive participation has a different (reverse) pattern, consistent with recent evidence (Sánchez-Barría & Miranda, 2022; Miranda & Castillo, 2021; Hoskins & Janmaat, 2019).

- Family socialization practices (conversation) is relevant for all types of participation. In all cases, it promotes participation.

  + But, the effect tends to be contingent.
  
  + The effect of the conversation that occurred at an early age is diluted over time.
  
  + However, the family conversation can be activated in each contingency.
